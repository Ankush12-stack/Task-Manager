# Task Management Application

## Overview

This is a simple task management application built using **React**. It allows users to:

- Add, edit, and delete tasks.
- Set task details such as title, description, due date, and priority (High, Medium, Low).
- View tasks in categories such as upcoming, overdue, and completed.
- Search for tasks and filter them based on priority and completion status.
- Data is stored locally using **localStorage**, so tasks persist between page reloads.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, and delete tasks with customizable details.
- **Priority Levels**: Tasks can be assigned High, Medium, or Low priority.
- **Search and Filter**: Search tasks by title and filter them based on priority and completion status.
- **Local Storage**: All task data is stored locally in the browser's localStorage, ensuring persistence.
- **Animations**: Smooth animations for adding, deleting, and marking tasks as complete.
- **UI Libraries (Optional)**: Integration examples with **Bootstrap** and **Material-UI** for advanced UI components.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 12 or above)
- **npm** or **yarn** (package managers)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/task-manager-app.git
   cd task-manager-app

   ```

2. Install dependencies: Using npm:
   npm install

3. Start the development server: Using npm:
   npm start

4. Open the app in your browser: Once the development server is running, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to access the task management app.

Building the App for Production
To build the app for production, use the following command:
npm run build

This will create an optimized build of the application in the build folder, which can then be deployed to a production environment.
